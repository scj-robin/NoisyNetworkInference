\begin{itemize}
 \item $p = 20, 30, 50, 80$ nodes
 \item $n = 20, 50, 100, 200$ replicates
 \item $K =3$ clusters
 \item $\pi = (1/6; 1/3, 1/2)$
 \item $\gamma$ higher for smaller clusters, density $\overline{\gamma} = \pi^\intercal \gamma \pi = 1.5 \log(p)/p$
 \item $G \sim SBM(p, \pi, \gamma)$ conditional on $G$ connected
 \item $\Omega = \text{Laplacian}(G)$ (+ increases the diagonal until positive-definite)
 \item $(Y_i)_{i = 1 \dots n}$ iid $\sim \Ncal(0, \Omega^{-1})$
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
 \item[oracle:] SBM fit on (unobserved) $G$
 \item[vemGlasso:] proposed VEM on glasso scores
 \item[vemMB:] proposed VEM on M-B scores
 \item[vemTree:] proposed VEM on tree-based edge probalities
 \item[sbmGlasso:] pipe-line = SBM on $\widehat{G}_{glasso}$ (with $eBIC$ selection)
 \item[vemMB:] pipe-line = SBM on $\widehat{G}_{MB}$ (with $ric$ selection)
 \item[vemTree:] pipe-line = SBM on $\widehat{G}_{Tree}$ (with edge proba $> 2 /p$ selection)
